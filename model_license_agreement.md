# [Liblicense Model License Agreement & Commentary][] #

<em>Adapted from http://liblicense.crl.edu/licensing-information/model-license/.</em>

## Introduction ##

This Liblicense Model License Agreement (“LMLA”) has been prepared to assist information professionals, executives, and others who regularly acquire digital, database content for educational purposes or markets. The intent of this LMLA is to present information professionals with a sound and realistic template of the key issues involved in negotiating a license to acquire or use database content.

While LMLA may be used in most database licensing situations, it has been drafted with a particular focus on licensing issues in higher education. LMLA’s terms and conditions are based on United States common and statutory law, and it presumes the licensor or publisher will make the information available through a password- or otherwise protected Web site for one year.

To be of maximum value, this document should be used only as a reference document that assists professionals in negotiating (or preparing to negotiate) database content license agreements. Under no circumstances should any person or organization use or adopt the LMLA in its entirety, or use it as the sole or exclusive basis for negotiating a license contract.

Several LMLA provisions (including the jurisdiction and warranty provisions) likely will require modification in order to serve your organization’s purposes. If you plan to use LMLA as the basis for your institution’s license agreement, Liblicense editors strongly recommend that you review and amend this model agreement with the assistance of a capable attorney who has experience in dealing with commercial contracts, licensing, and institutional policy.

We recommend the National Information Standards Organization’s [Shared E-Resource Understanding][] (“SERU”) for those that seek to a shorter alternative to the current LMLA.

## Reader Notes ##
1. Editorial notes are enclosed in curly brackets and italicized like this: {<em>editorial notes in italics between curly brackets</em>}. These comments should not appear in an actual license agreement.

2. Where a clause requires one or more parties to enter information, those options are delineated by the open, square brackets around bold faced type like this: [<strong>enter necessary information between square brackets</strong>]. These comments should not appear in an actual license agreement.

3. Footnotes are used exclusively to list Web site uniform resource locators, and are provided for convenience only. Neither the footnote markers nor the footnote text should appear in any final agreement. If your final agreement references external Web sites, the uniform resource locators (URLs) for those sites should be incorporated into the appropriate defined terms.

Licensor will allow the Licensee and its Authorized Users to have access to the Licensed Materials pursuant to the terms, conditions, directives or specifications set forth in Appendix B. {<em>Liblicense editors suggest that these issues be negotiated and addressed in an Appendix to the main Agreement.

## 9. Miscellaneous Provisions ##

9.1 Assignment and Transfer. Neither party may assign, directly or indirectly, all or part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Neither party to this Agreement may unreasonably withhold or delay such written consent.

9.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed according to, and governed by, the laws of [<strong>venue convenient to Licensor and Licensee</strong>], excluding any such laws that might direct the application of another jurisdiction’s laws. The federal or state courts located in [<strong>venue convenient to Licensor and Licensee</strong>] shall have jurisdiction to hear any dispute under this Agreement.

9.3 Dispute Resolution. In the event any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the parties agree to exercise their best efforts to resolve the dispute as soon as possible.

If the Licensor and Licensee cannot resolve their dispute after reasonable effort and a reasonable period of time, the parties agree to resolve the dispute using one of the following methods in lieu of litigation. {<em>The mediation clause and arbitration clauses may be chosen together, or the arbitration clause may be chosen by itself.</em>}

<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
  <li>Mediation. The Licensor and Licensee may submit their dispute to a neutral, non-binding mediation prior to he commencement of arbitration, litigation, or any other proceeding before a trier of fact. The parties to the dispute or claim agree to act in good faith to participate in mediation, and to identify a mutually acceptable mediator. (If a mediator cannot be agreed upon by the parties, each party shall designate a mediator and those mediators shall select a third mediator who shall act as the neutral mediator, assisting the parties in attempting to reach a resolution.) The Licensor and Licensee will share equally in the cost of the mediator(s), and commit to completing at least four hours of mediation before seeking any other dispute resolution method, legal remedy, or equitable remedy. If the mediation is successful, its resolution will be documented by a written agreement executed by all parties. If the mediation does not successfully resolve the dispute or claim, the mediator shall provide written notice to both parties. At this point, the Licensee and Licensor may seek another alternative form of resolution of the dispute or claim, consistent with the remaining terms of this agreement and other legal rights and remedies, or commence litigation.</li>

  <li>Arbitration. If mediation does not resolve a controversy or dispute between the Licensor and Licensee, the parties shall resolve the dispute by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The parties shall select a mutually acceptable arbitrator knowledgeable about issues relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. (In the event the parties are unable to agree to such a selection, each party will select an arbitrator and the arbitrators in turn shall select a third arbitrator.) The arbitration shall take place at a location that is reasonably centrally located between the parties, or otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties. All documents, materials, and information in the possession of each party that are in any way relevant to the claim(s) or dispute(s) shall be made available to the other party for review and copying no later than [<strong>enter time period</strong>] after the notice of arbitration is served. The arbitrator(s) shall not have the authority, power, or right to alter, change, amend, modify, add, or subtract from any provision of this Agreement or to award punitive damages. The arbitrator shall have the power to issue mandatory orders and restraining orders in connection with the arbitration. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction. The agreement to arbitration shall be specifically enforceable under prevailing arbitration law. During the continuance of any arbitration proceeding, the parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.</li>
</ol>

9.4 Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable in damages or have the right to terminate this Agreement for any delay or default in performing hereunder if such delay or default is caused by conditions beyond its control, including Acts of God, Government restrictions (including the denial or cancellation of any export or other necessary license), wars, insurrections and/or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the party whose performance is affected.

9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior communications, understandings and agreements relating to the subject matter hereof, whether oral or written.

9.7 Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or in conflict with the law of any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

9.8 Waiver of Contractual Right. Waiver of any provision herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision herein, nor shall waiver of any breach of this Agreement be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or other provisions of this Agreement.

9.9 Notices. All notices given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be sent to the contract addresses noted in the first paragraph of this Agreement. All notices may be hand delivered, or shall be deemed received within [<strong>enter time period</strong>] after mailing if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
